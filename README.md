# Deep Learning for Medical Resource Allocation in a Pandemic

## Abstract

COVID-19 is a novel pandemic with serious clinical manifestations. Insofar, it has reached more than 180 countries and territories. During the time of the pandemic, the entire US community is facing medical resource scarcities. The problem of how to efficiently allocate and deliver a fixed amount of medical resources including but not limited to masks, potential vaccines and ventilators subject to constraints such as inter-county transportation and limited budget for delivery costs remain unsolved. In this study, we develop a model that utilizes the minimum covered vertex set as a solution to optimal resource allocation. Based on the minimum covered set, a traveling salesman problem (TSP) model is used to determine the optimal path of delivery which incurs minimum total cost.
