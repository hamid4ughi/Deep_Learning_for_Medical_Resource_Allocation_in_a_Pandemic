# Deep Learning for Medical Resource Allocation in a Pandemic

## Introduction

In December, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei province, China, became the centre of an outbreak, which raised intense attention not only within China but internationally. In a short time, COVID-19 became a new pandemic with nearly three million confirmed cases all around the world. In the current COVID-19 outbreak, infection control and clinical management efforts are necessarily being implemented on a larger scale than in any previous outbreak, and it is therefore appropriate to reassess the allocation methods for medical resources. Deep-learning algorithms has been used by many researchers to provide more insight into different aspects of previous pandemics from infection to disease management. In the current study,a geographic dataset of Maryland counties has been used to develop a model that utilizes the minimum vertex cover set as a solution to optimal resource allocation. Based on the minimum cover set, a traveling salesman problem (TSP) model is used to determine the optimal path of delivery which incurs minimum total cost.
